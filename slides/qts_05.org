* General things
** What we did
- We tackled the time-dependent analysis of queueing systems, with construction and simulation.
- Time dependent case is too hard: settle for  characterization  of average behavior
- Distinguish between time and sample (job arrival) averages in KPIs
- For sensible average behavior utilization we need stability, i.e., $\rho = \lambda \E S/c <1$.
** What we are going to do next
- Sakasegawa's formula for $\E{W(G/C/c)}$.
- Application of Sakasegawa's formula to a batch queue.
** Later
- More application of Sakasegawa's formula
- Analytical models for $M/M/c$ and $M/G/1$ queue.


* Sakasegawa's formula, 4.1
** The formula
\begin{align}
\label{eq:1}
\rho &= \lambda   \E S /c \\
\E W &= \frac{C_{a}^2 + C_s^{2}}{2}\frac{\rho^{\sqrt{2(c+1)}-1}}{1-\rho} \frac{\E S}{c}\\
C_{a}^2 &= \frac{\V X}{(\E X)^{2}} \\
C_{s}^2 &= \frac{\V S}{(\E S)^{2}} \\
\end{align}
- Why is this so useful? (part 1 of 4.1)
- main insights
- How to estimate $C_{a}^{2}$ from other data? (part 2 of 4.1)

* Queues with setups, 4.2
** why batching?
- Jobs have certain characteristics, e.g., color.
- server needs to be cleaned when changing color.
- Cleaning takes time
- work in batches of jobs with the same characteristics

** What happens logistically?

- time for arrivals to form a batch
- time spent in queue
- time spent at server
- time to regroup?

** time for arrivals to form a batch

\begin{align}
\label{eq:2}
 \E{\W_i} &= \frac{B-1}{2\lambda_i}, \quad i\in \{r, b\} \\
\end{align}

Linear in $B$.

** Time batch spends in queue
- Use Sakasegawa's formula
- main components $\lambda$, $\E S$, $C_{a}^{2}$, $C_{s}^{2}$, $c$.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:3}
\lambda &= \lambda_{r} + \lambda_{b} \\
\E{S_{0}} &\\
\E{S_B} &= \E R + B\E{S_0}, \\
\E{S} &= \E R/B + \E{S_0}, \\
c &= 1,\\
\rho &= \lambda \E S = \lambda \E R /B + \lambda \E{S_{0}}.
\end{align}

- $\rho$ is  decreasing in $B$!

** SCVs.
\begin{align}
C_{a, B}^{2} &= \frac{\V{\sum_{i}^{B} X_{i}}}{(\E{\sum_{i}^{B} X_{i}}^{2})^{2}}= \frac{B \V X}{ B^{2}(\E X)^{2}}= \frac{C_{a}^{2}}{B} \\
\V{S_{B}} &= \V{R} + B \V{S_{0}}
\end{align}
We have all we need to fill in Sakasegawa's formula.

** Time at server
- wait for your turn: $\E R + (B-1)\E{S_{0}}/2$
- get server: $\E{S_{0}}$

** Regrouping after service
- If jobs can leave directly, we are done.
- Wait for a batch of size $B'$ to form: $(B' -1 ) \E S_{0}/2$.
** Performance analysis
- Add up all  expected times to get $\E J$
- Make graph of $\E J$ as function of e.g. batch size,
