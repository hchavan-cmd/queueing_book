* Status and Plan
** Plan
- Past: recursions
  - Numerical methods to compute $p(n)$ ($=\pi(n)$) for $M^{X}/M/1$.
  - Recursion to compute  $p(n)$ ($=\pi(n)$) for $M/G/1$.
- Now: Simple queueing control.
  - Compute the long-run average cost of an $M/M/1$ (first) and a $M/G/1$ (second) under an $N$ policy.
  - We use many of the concepts we developed earlier.
  - A set of highly elegant and very useful ideas.
- Next:
  - An open network of $M/M/c$ queues
  - Fixed points of the (vector) equation $\lambda = \gamma + \lambda P$ and $v = c + P v$.
* N policy for the $M/M/1$ queue
** Model
- Jobs arrive as a Poisson proces with rate $\lambda$.
- Service times are iid, $S\sim \Exp{\mu}$.
- $\rho = \lambda/\mu < 1$, system is stable
- As soon as the server becomes idle, it switches off
-  The server pays $K$ \euro to switch on
- The server pays $h$ \euro per unit time per job in the system.
** Problem for $N$ policy
Three steps:
- System starts empty, pay jobs until $N$ in system.
- Pay $K$ to switch on
- As long as jobs are present, pay each of them
Which $N$ minimes the long-run average cost?
**  Steps to Solve:
- Start at zero, find expected cost $W(q)$ to hit $q$.
- Start at some level $q$, find expected time $T(q)$ until  empty
- Start at some level $q$, find expected cost $V(q)$ until  empty
- Combine all components and apply renewal reward.
We start with finding an expression for $T(q)$ and $V(q)$.

** Analysis, expected time $T(q)$ to hit 0
- If there were no stochasticity, the net outflow is $\mu-\lambda$, hence $T(q) = q/(\mu-\lambda)$.
- But there is stochasticity!
- Use recursion!  With this:
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:92}
  T(q) =  \frac{1}{\lambda+\mu} + \frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu} T(q+1) + \frac{\mu}{\lambda+\mu} T(q-1).
\end{equation}
- To solve, /guess/ the form $T(q) = a q + b$, and substitute.
- $T(0) = 0 \implies b = 0$. Solving for $a$ gives
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:92}
  T(q) =  \frac{q}{\mu-\lambda}.
\end{equation}
** Analysis, expected cost $V(q)$  to hit 0.
- Recursion, $\alpha = \lambda/(\lambda+\mu), \beta = \mu/(\lambda+\mu)$,
\begin{equation}
  V(q) = h\frac{q}{\lambda + \mu} + \alpha V(q+1) + \beta V(q-1).
\end{equation}
- To solve, /guess/ the form $V(q) = a q^{2} + bq + c$.
- $V(0) = 0 \implies c = 0$. Solving for $a, b$ gives
\begin{equation}
  V(q) = \frac h 2 \frac 1 {\mu -\lambda} q^2 + \frac h 2 \frac{\lambda + \mu}{(\mu - \lambda)^2}q.
\end{equation}
** Application to $M/M/1$
- Average number of jobs in system is $\E\L$.
- Hence, average pay is $h \E\L$.
- Set $K=0$
- $C(1)$? \pause $C(1) = 1/\lambda + T(1)$.
- Renewal reward $h \E\L = V(1)/C(1)$.
- Exercise: show that $V(1)/C(1) = h \rho/(1-\rho)$.

** Analysis, expected cost $W(q)$  to move to $q$
- Recursion:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:99}
  W(q) =  W(q-1) +  h\frac{q-1}{\lambda} = h \frac{q(q-1)}{2\lambda}.
\end{equation}
** Analysis, expected cycle time
- Expected time to start at 0, wait until level $N$ is hit, switch on, process jobs until empty, and restart.
\begin{equation*}
C(N) = N/\lambda + T(N).
\end{equation*}
** Long-run average cost
- Final result
\begin{align*}
  \frac{\W(N)+K+V(N)}{C(N)} =
  \frac{\W(N)+K+V(N)}{N/\lambda + T(N)}.
\end{align*}

* N policy for the $M/G/1$ queue.
** Analysis
- Unlike the $M/M/1$ queue: there is no memoryless during service times.
- Focus on  job departure times. The inter-arrival times are Exp, so still memoryless.
- Solving is  similar to the $M/M/1$ queue
- But,  deal with costs due to arrivals  during a service time.

** Analysis, expected time $T(q)$ to hit 0
- $Y$ jobs arrive during a service.
- Use recursion:
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:92}
  T(q) =  \E S + \E{T(q+Y-1)}.
\end{equation}
- Substitute the /guess/  $T(q) = a q + b$.
- Using that $T(0)=0$, solving for $a, b$ gives
\begin{equation*}
T(q) = \frac{\E S}{1-\lambda \E S}q.
\end{equation*}
- Check that this is $q/(\mu-\lambda)$ for $M/M/1$.
** Analysis, expected cost $V(q)$  to hit 0.
- Use recursion:
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:98}
  V(q) = U(q) + \E{V(q+Y-1)}.
\end{equation}
- $U(q)$ is expected cost of jobs waiting during a service $S$.
\begin{equation*}
  U(q) = h q \E S + \E{H(S)}
\end{equation*}
- $\E{H(S)}$ is expected cost of new jobs entering during the service.
** Analyis: cost of new arrivals
- Suppose $s$ amount of service remains.
- When a new job arrives, we pay it immediately $hs$, but nothing while it is in the system.
- What can happen during a period $\delta\ll 1$?
  - $\P{\text{no new arrival}} = 1-\lambda \delta$,  pay $U(s-\delta)$
  - $\P{\text{one new arrival}} = \lambda \delta$,  pay $hs+U(s-\delta)$
  - Neglect multiple arrivals as probability is $o(\delta)$.
- Hence:
\begin{align*}
  H(s) &=  (1-\lambda \delta)\cdot 0 + \lambda \delta \cdot h s + H(s-\delta) + o(\delta), \\
H'(s) &= \lambda h s, \quad H(0) = 0, \\
H(s) &= \lambda h s^{2}/ 2\\
\E{H(S)} &= \lambda h \E{S^{2}}/2.
\end{align*}
** Analysis, expected cost $V(q)$  to hit 0.
- Hence
\begin{align*}
  V(q) &= U(q) + \E{V(q+Y-1)} \\
&= h q \E S + \E{H(S)} +  \E{V(q+Y-1)} \\
&= h q \E S + \lambda h \E{S^{2}}/2 +  \E{V(q+Y-1)}.
\end{align*}
- Substitute  $V(q) = aq^2 + bq+c$, and solve for $a, b, c$, with boundary condition $V(0) = 0$.
- After some work this gives
\begin{align*}
  V(q) &= \frac{h}{2}\frac{\E S}{1-\rho} q^2 + h  \frac{ 1+ \rho C_s^2}2 \frac{\E S}{(1-\rho)^2} q.
\end{align*}
** Long-run  average cost
- Final result
\begin{align}  \label{eq:100}
&    \frac{W(N) + K + V(N)}{C(N)}\\
&= h \frac{1+ C_s^2}2 \frac{\rho^2}{1-\rho} + h \rho + h \frac{N-1}2 + K \frac{\lambda(1-\rho)}N.
\end{align}
- Setting $N=1$ gives the PK formula
- Optimal $N^{*}$:
\begin{equation*}
  N^* \approx \sqrt{\frac{2\lambda(1-\rho)K}{h}} \to \sqrt{\frac{2\lambda K}h}, \quad\text{as } \E S \to 0.
\end{equation*}
- These are the Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formulas.
